__Problem Statement__
- In the past few years, the malware industry has grown very rapidly that, the syndicates invest heavily in technologies to evade traditional protection, forcing the anti-malware groups/communities to build more robust softwares to detect and terminate these attacks. 
- The major part of protecting a computer system from a malware attack is to identify whether a given piece of file/software is a malware.

__Source/Useful Links__
- Microsoft has been very active in building anti-malware products over the years and it runs itâ€™s anti-malware utilities over 150 million computers around the world. This generates tens of millions of daily data points to be analyzed as potential malware. 
- In order to be effective in analyzing and classifying such large amounts of data, we need to be able to group them into groups and identify their respective families.
- This dataset provided by Microsoft contains about 9 classes of malware. ,

__Real-world/Business objectives and constraints__
- Minimize multi-class error.
- Multi-class probability estimates.
- Malware detection should not take hours and block the user's computer. It should fininsh in a few seconds or a minute.
